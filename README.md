A calculator to help with invoicing for Norwegian film crew members.

The intention is to make a simple Python script that does what I need it to at first.
And then, maybe use this as a basic project for learning C++ later by creating a GUI version.
No promises.

EDIT: Probably still not making a GUI version, but turns out that I just don't like python as much as I used to, so here we go with making it in C++.

And no warranty or guarantees. This software does not give financial advice.
